# Tagion SDK

Tagion SDK is a cross-platform development kit that makes it easy to develop, test and debug scripts and applications for Tagion network.

# Latest Release

> Release 2020.2 does not include any GUI ~~because nobody on the team knows how to interact with those futuristic 'visual interfaces' made for millennials~~. We invite you to the [`./core`](./core) directory to learn how to interact with core CLI directly, ~~like all the real devs do~~.

The cross-platform desktop application with GUI is in early stages of development, and the basic usable client will be available starting from next release, 2020.3a1.

In this release, SDK Core modules are available as binaries.


# Release Cycle

We aim to release new version every month. All minor updates and fixes published between releases will increment the version of that release.

The naming of the release represents the year, month and a version:

* **a** - alpha release
* **b** - beta release
* **f** - final release
* **p** - patch for final release

Examples of release names:

* **2020.3a1** First alpha release for March, 2020
* **2020.9p3** Third patch for final release for September, 2020
